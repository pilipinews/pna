SHARIFF AGUAK, MAGUINDANAO - Authorities arrested Tuesday two village councilors here for possession of unlicensed high-powered firearms.

The Criminal Investigation and Detection Group in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (CIDG-ARMM) identified the arrested as Hadji Salipada Lidasan and Badrudin Kutin, both village councilors of Barangay Poblacion 2 in this town.

Armed with a search warrant issued by a local court, CIDG-ARMM members, backed by police intelligence units and the Army's 57th Infantry Battalion, swooped down Tuesday morning on the residence of Lidasan, the primary subject of the warrant, in Barangay Poblacion 2.

"The suspect (Lidasan) did not resist arrest," said Chief Inspector Esmael Madin, CIDG - Maguindanao field office chief.

Lidasan said the firearm was for self-defense and security purposes.

The raiding team also nabbed Kutin for displaying his M16 rifle during the law enforcement operation. Madin said while they were implementing the search at Lidasan's house, they noticed Kutin, with an M16 rifle, closely watching from a house nearby.

Both village officials were arrested after failing to present proper documents for their firearms. Seized from them were two M16 rifles, four loaded magazines, a bandolier vest, and ammunition.

Madin said their office has long been strictly implementing "Oplan Paglalansag Omega" in the province.

The village officials' arrest came while this town is celebrating its 55th foundation anniversary.

The two are now detained at the CIDG-ARMM headquarters in Cotabato City, awaiting the filing of charges against them for violation of Republic Act 50191 or the Comprehensive Firearms and Ammunition Regulation Act. (PNA)
