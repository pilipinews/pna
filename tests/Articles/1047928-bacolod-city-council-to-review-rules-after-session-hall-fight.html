BACOLOD CITY -- The Bacolod City Council will review its internal rules after a councilor punched his colleague inside the session hall of the Sangguniang Panlungsod (city council) on Wednesday after a tension-filled debate over the proposed construction of a sanitary landfill.

"We will study the internal rules. It is not specific (about sanctions). It is up to the aggrieved party what actions to take," said Vice Mayor El Cid Familiaran, the council's presiding officer, in a press conference on Thurday.

Familiaran noted that the internal rules only provide for the aggressor-official to be reprimanded and excluded from the session, which the majority did through a resolution.

"It would be good to study this, if we can impose stiffer penalties if this happens again," the vice mayor said.

The scuffle took place right after Familiaran declared a recess after a heated discussion between Councilors Dindo Ramos and Claudio Puentevella related to the proposal to grant Mayor Evelio Leonardia the authority to sign the contract with garbage hauler, IPM-Construction and Development Corporation (IPM-CDC), for the construction of a second cell at the city's sanitary landfill in Barangay Felisa.

Puentevella said he received a copy of the contract only on Wednesday noon and then learned that the discussion to grant authority to the mayor will be discussed during the afternoon session.

Ramos responded that even when he has just received the document, he is ready to ask the IPM-CDC representatives the questions related to the proposed contract.

Apparently got irked by Ramos' response, Puentevella, right after the vice mayor declared a recess, stood up, went up to Ramos, and punched him on the face.

Videos of the scuffle went viral after various news outlets posted these on social media.

After the session, Ramos, who is a lawyer, said he will file criminal and administrative charges against Puentevella.

He said members of the council should not be carried away by their emotions since the session should be a venue for "exchange of ideas and exchange of opinions."

Ramos added that such physical violence has never happened before in the City Council.

Leonardia was in the press conference with Familiaran, Bacolod City Lone District Rep. Greg Gasataya, and other city officials.

He said as allies of Ramos in the ruling Grupo Progreso, they fully support him.

"We are all behind and we are all with Councilor Dindo Ramos," the mayor said.

Leonardia added that Ramos was not feeling well and did not make it to the press conference of the group.

Puentevella has yet to issue a press statement on the incident as of this writing. (PNA)
