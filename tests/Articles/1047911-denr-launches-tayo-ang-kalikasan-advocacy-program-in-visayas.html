ILOILO CITY -- Environment Secretary Roy Cimatu has appealed for the participation of people's organizations (POs) to become stewards of th eenvironment and not just leave the burden to the government.

Cimatu made the call in his message delivered by Undersecretary Rodolfo C. Garcia during the launch of the Visayas cluster of "Tayo Ang Kalikasan", a program for restoration, rehabilitation and development (PRRDP), in this city on Thursday.

"We cannot and should not place the burden on the government alone, considering the government's limited resources. Communities -- given the means -- are in the best position to act immediately and respond to local needs," he said.

He said the "Tayo Ang Kalikasan" is the "product of the faith in our people."

"I personally believe that our people are capable of change for the better, if not the best. I believe that from being part of the problem, our people can become the solution. I believe too that people care for clean air, clean water, healthy habitat and a productive environment," he added.

He cited the impact of the more than 21 million population of the three regions of Visayas should they "move together with unity of mission and vision."

During the ceremony, officers of various POs made their pledge of commitment to support the program. Participants also affixed their signatures to the Commitment Wall.

"We bank on our POs because they are our strength," said Assistant Regional Director for Technical Services Livino B. Duran, in an interview.

The first to heed the call was the PO from Guimaras whose officers took their oath of office during the program.
Youth representatives were also presented with seedlings as part of the ceremony.

"The seedling distribution was part of the TAK launch, which encourages youth participation to help protect, conserve and rehabilitate the environment," Duran said.

The advocacy program he said covers several areas and their actions will depend on the area where they are located. Among their steps are to embark on information and education campaign, implement eco-friendly programs and projects, among others. (PNA)
