LOCAL INPUTS SOUGHT IN MENTAL HEALTH LAW IMPLEMENTATION

CAGAYAN DE ORO CITY -- The task force assigned to draft the implementing rules and regulation (IRR) of Republic Act No. 11036 or the "Mental Health Act", has sought local perspectives to make the law more inclusive.

Dr. Dinah Palmera P. Nadera, a mental health policy consultant who led Wednesday's focus group discussion (FGD) and consultation with different local stakeholders here, said the law's implementation should reflect the broader spectrum of the population to make it more effective in addressing mental health issues.

Nadera is part of the task force supervised by the Department of Health and supported by the World Health Organization to draw up the law's IRR. President Rodrigo Duterte signed the law in June.

She said there have been numerous meetings and consultations with various government and non-government agencies and organizations to make the law reflective of its intended purpose.

One consideration, she said, is the unique mental health perspectives of different tribal groups that have varying traditional practices on the subject.

Indigenous Peoples (IPs) may have "a different take on this (mental health) based on their culture," she pointed out.

Nadera said the FGD participants will be gathered as a regional bloc, whose members will then delegate a representative to collate all the suggestions and send it to the task force for consideration.

One of the FGD participants, Angie Abellanosa, said she hopes the new law would generate more substantive discussions on mental health, especially among Persons with Disabilities (PWDs).

"They thought that when you say 'PWDs', it's only limited to physical handicaps. People would not usually include those with mental health challenges, such as children with autism," she noted.

Nadera said that after the regional proposals have been gathered, a public consultation will be rolled out beginning October 20. (PNA)
