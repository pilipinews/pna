DAGUPAN ADDRESSING FLOOD PROBLEM: MAYOR

DAGUPAN CITY -- Mayor Belen Fernandez underscored measures to deal with floods being undertaken by the city government for the past five years.
In her State-of-the-City Address (SOCA) on Monday, Fernandez said she is working with national government agencies that have the expertise, data and recommendations.

The mayor said 4th District Rep. Christopher de Venecia informed her that Public Works Secretary Mark Villar has approved his request for additional river dikes, flood gates, pumping stations, and road elevation.

She said that backfilling of fishponds where the new city hall will be constructed does not contribute to the slow flow of floodwater to the river.

Fernandez challenged those claiming this to excavate the area to prove what she is saying.

"They are putting the blame on me," the mayor lamented, saying it is unfair that the flooding problem in the city, especially the series of flooding incidents last July and August, are being blamed on her.

"When did we start solving the problem? Not today, not yesterday, but four to five years ago," she said.

Fernandez further identified other measures the city government has been undertaking to solve flooding, such as the river clean-up drive, including the removal of fish pens that hamper the flow of water, construction of dikes along the rivers, and the elevation of barangay and sitio roads.

She said the dredging of the Pantal River continues as the amount of silt accumulated is enormous.

"The estimated volume of silt is 2 million cubic meters. What has been removed is just about 500,000 cubic meters. The problem is, silt from the upland continues to flow to our rivers," she said.

Fernandez said she was "on top of the situation" during the recent flooding, noting she visited the barangays to determine where the floodwaters were coming from and to look for possible solutions.

Greatly affected were barangays Malued, Lasip Grande, Bacayao Sur, Bacayao Norte, and the neighboring barangays.

The mayor said the water came from the Sinocalan River or Marusay River in Calasiao. (PNA)
