20 INMATES AT S. COTABATO JAIL POSITIVE OF DRUG USE

GENERAL SANTOS CITY -- Security measures have been tightened at the South Cotabato Rehabilitation and Detention Center or provincial jail in Koronadal City after 20 of its inmates yielded positive of drug use in surprise tests.

Juan Lanzaderas, provincial jail warden, said Thursday such results were based on the random drug tests conducted last week on 65 of the jail's more than 1,300 inmates.

He said they commissioned the drug tests over reports regarding the continued entry of illegal drugs into the facility.

"We were surprised by the results. It shows that the problem still persists," Lanzaderas said in radio interview.

The official said they are working on moving the 20 inmates, who denied using illegal drugs, into a single detention cell to properly monitor their movements.

He said they strengthened the security protocol at the jail entrance and perimeter to prevent the entry of illegal drugs, especially metamphetamine hydrochloride or shabu.

These include the conduct of intensive inspections on all visitors entering the provincial jail compound, he said.

Lanzaderas said they also imposed restrictions on the jail guards and personnel on the bringing of backpacks and cellphones into the facility.

"Those who will be found involved in the entry of illegal drugs will be dealt with accordingly," he said.

He said they are also planning to conduct more random drug tests among their inmates, especially those facing cases involving illegal drugs.

Lanzanderas said they are targeting to subject at least 100 inmates a month for the tests, which the provincial government had supported.

Jail personnel had recovered illegal drugs, especially shabu, in the possession of some inmates in a number of surprise inspections these past years.

Several visitors doubling as drug couriers had been also arrested while trying to sneak in illegal substance into the facility. (PNA)
