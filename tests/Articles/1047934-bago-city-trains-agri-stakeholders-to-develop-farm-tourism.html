BACOLOD CITY -- About 40 participants from 15 farms and farmers cooperatives and associations in Bago City, Negros Occidental attended a two-day orientation to develop the southern city's farm tourism sector.

The farm tourism training was held at the Buenos Aires Mountain Resort in Barangay Ilijan until Wednesday.

Provincial Supervising Tourism Operations Officer Cristine Mansinares, who was one of the resource speakers, said on Thursday that Bago is one of the three cities in Negros Occidental which participated in the Global Farm Tourism Summit in Tagaytay City last July.

The other two are San Carlos and Victorias in northern Negros.

Mansinares said Bago City is pushing for the inclusion of more barangays with potential farms in the development of farm tourism circuit.

Among the topics discussed were the Farm Tourism Development Act of 2016 by Department of Tourism 6 (Western Visayas) administrative officer Artemio Ticar, and farm tourism promotions and the "from farm to table" concept by Negrense agripreneur Ramon Uy.

Mansinares, who discussed farm tourism opportunities and other general information about farm tourism in Negros Occidental, said the participants visited farms in Bago to learn about their offerings.

These included Matti's Rambutan Farm, Oisca Sericulture Farm, Bee Well Farmstead, and Sta. Monica Healing Gardens.

Mansinares said the orientation will help the city government come up with a baseline data for its tourism development roadmap.

Bago City is mapping out potential farms for the creation of tourism circuit, she added.

"The purpose is to develop a farm tourism village composed of one or more barangays," Mansinares said.

She also said the development of local farm tourism is a priority of the Department of Tourism and Negros Occidental Tourism Division.

"The one in Bago is the second farm tourism orientation conducted in Negros Occidental following the international summit. The first activity was in San Carlos City in July," she added. (PNA)
