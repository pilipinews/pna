DENGUE CASES DOWN 41%, LEPTOSPIROSIS UP 90% IN BACOLOD

BACOLOD CITY -- Dengue cases in this city dropped by 41 percent while leptospirosis cases increased by 90 percent from January 1 to September 8 this year compared to the same period last year, records of the City Health Office (CHO) showed.

During the period in 2018, dengue cases reached 747, including seven deaths. In 2017, there were 1,265 cases, including nine deaths.

Dr. Grace Tan, head of the CHO Environment Sanitation Division, said Wednesday that despite the lower cases, they continue to encourage the public to sustain the 4 o'clock habit of clearing mosquito breeding places.

She noted that mosquitoes come out of their breeding sites two hours before sunset thus, a regular afternoon clean-up both in and outside the house will help prevent dengue.

Tan also discouraged the catching of spiders for cobwebs to thrive, and screen and trap mosquitoes.

CHO records show the latest two of the seven fatalities, a seven-year-old girl and six-year-old boy, were reported on September 1 and 8.

The Top 10 barangays with the highest number of cases are Handumanan, with 75 cases; Taculing, 64; Mansilingan, 63; Sum-ag, 55; Singcang-Airport, 50; Villamonte, 47; Estefania, 45; and Alijis, 41; Granada 34; and Tangub, 33.

Meanwhile, leptospirosis cases increased to 19 cases, including three deaths, from the previous year's 10, including three deaths.

Tan did not identify the reason for the higher cases during the period, but reiterated her advice to avoid wading in flood water and to properly dispose of garbage as part of maintaining cleanliness to prevent leptospirosis.

"If you cannot avoid wading in flood water, use boots. You can go to the health center for information and for advisory if there is a need for you to take prophylaxis," she added.

Leptospirosis is a bacterial infection caused by the leptospira spirochetes bacteria contracted through the urine of infected animals, especially rats. Exposure to flood waters can cause infection, especially to those with cuts, wounds or abrasions on their skin. (PNA)
