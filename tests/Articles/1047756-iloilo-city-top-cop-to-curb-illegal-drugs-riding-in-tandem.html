ILOILO CITY -- The new director of the Iloilo City Police Office (ICPO) on Wednesday vowed to curb illegal drug activities in the city and the number of killings by riding-in-tandem gunmen.

Senior Supt. Martin Defensor Jr., on his first day as the new director, called for a staff conference to give clear guidelines and plans for ICPO.

He is particularly pushing for discipline and internal cleansing among his subordinates.

He said that he will also assess the performance of all chiefs of police in the different districts of the city before he decides on a revamp.

"I already have in mind how to counter this riding-in-tandem problem, although I was not yet briefed of the real situation," he said in an interview.

"They say that you fight fire with fire, so if they will not stop, we have to show them how we work," he added.

Data from the ICPO showed three killings perpetrated by riding-in-tandem gunmen, with mostly drug surrenderers as victims, were recorded this month alone.

Defensor assumed his new post in a turn-over command ceremony Wednesday presided by Chief Supt.Carlito Feliciano, Deputy Regional Director for Administration of the Police Regional Office in Western Visayas (PRO-6).

Defensor replaced Senior Supt. Henry Bi√±as who was reassigned as chief of the PRO-6's Regional Personnel and Human Resource Development Division.

A graduate of the Philippine National Police Academy (PNPA) batch 1993, Defensor grew up in Janiuay, Iloilo.

His early assignments as police officer were mostly in Luzon.

In 2015, he was assigned to PRO-6 as Chief of the Regional Comptroller Division and also served as intelligence officer.

Defensor noted that his new post will bring bigger responsibility but he assured he will perform well.

"I take life with a grain of salt. I do not immediately panic but every day I always do good," he said.

"When I do things honestly and my credibility and integrity are intact, there is nothing to fear," he added. (PNA)
