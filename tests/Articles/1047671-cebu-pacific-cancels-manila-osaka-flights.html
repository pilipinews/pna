CEBU PACIFIC CANCELS MANILA-OSAKA FLIGHTS

MANILA -- Cebu Pacific (CEB) has cancelled flights between Manila and Osaka scheduled on Sept. 13, due to repairs still being undertaken at the Kansai International Airport.

The CEB management said the flights affected are 5J 828 Manila-Osaka, and 5J 827 Osaka-Manila.

Typhoon Jebi made landfall in eastern Shikoku midday September 4. "Jebi" was described as "the most powerful storm in Japan in 25 years." 

Operations at the Kansai International Airport were suspended after sections became flooded as a result of a storm surge. Airport facilities, including the runway, were damaged, reports said. 

The airport partially resumed operations on September 8, however, it can only accommodate a limited number of aircraft while rehabilitation is ongoing.

"Terminal 1 of Kansai International Airport is still not fully operational. Hence, we cannot resume our flights," CEB spokesperson Charo Lagamon told the Philippine News Agency (PNA) Tuesday evening.

Passengers of the canceled flights are given the option to reroute to Narita or Nagoya, or they may seek a refund, she said.

Meanwhile, CEB advises passengers that there is no assurance of normal flights to and from Osaka within the next few days, as these would depend on the progress of repairs at the Kansai International Airport. (PNA)
