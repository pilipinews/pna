LTFRB URGES PUVS TO STAY ALERT FOR 'OMPONG' ONSLAUGHT

MANILA - The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) advised public utility vehicles to be on alert for possible occurrences of strong winds, flashfloods and landslides due to Typhoon Ompong.

This, as "Ompong" continues to make its way into northern Luzon based on the latest weather bulletin from the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA).

"Due to typhoon signal and the continuing heavy rains being experienced in Metro Manila and various parts of the country due to Typhoon Ompong, all public utility vehicles are strongly advised to take precautionary measures and prepare for possible occurrence of strong winds, flash floods and landslides," the LTFRB said in an advisory Thursday.

"All public utility buses plying affected routes are advised to monitor the weather before departure and if necessary, remain at their respective terminals," it added.

Meanwhile, the management of the Metro Rail Transit Line 3 (MRT-3) has assured commuters that it will ensure the availability of its trains.

It will also replenish the necessary emergency tools and equipment, such as first aid kit supplies, operational flashlights and portable radios, as well as secure structures or objects may fall due to strong winds.

All submersible pumps will be ensured to be operational and drainages will be cleared of debris.

MRT-3 will coordinate with the Philippine National Police, National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council, Metropolitan Manila Development Authority, and other emergency responders, such as the Red Cross and will closely monitor typhoon status through the weather bulletins of PAGASA. (PR)
