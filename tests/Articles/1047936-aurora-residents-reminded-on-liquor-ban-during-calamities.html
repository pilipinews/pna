AURORA RESIDENTS REMINDED ON LIQUOR BAN DURING CALAMITIES

BALER, AURORA -- The Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (PDRRMC) headed by acting Governor Rommel Rico T. Angara on Thursday reminded the residents on the imposition of the liquor ban in times of calamities.

PDRRMO head Amado Elson A. Egargue noted the automatic implementation of provincial ordinance No. 221, an ordinance declaring liquor ban in times of calamities in this province as part of disaster risk reduction management measures.

He said that people's awareness and alertness are important factors in disaster preparedness.

"Drunkenness is one of the reasons why several villagers refused to live their homes during preemptive evacuation calls by barangay officials," Egargue said, pointing out the importance of prioritizing safety.

Under the ordinance, violators will be fined PHP1,500 for the 1st offense; PHP3,000 for second offense; and PHP5,000 and imprisonment of not exceeding six months or both at the discretion of the court, for third offense. (PNA)
