BACOOR CITY, CAVITe - The city government, through its village affairs office and the city police force, will jointly hold "Ugnayan ng Kapulisan, Barangay, at Siklista" (UKBAS) -- a fun bike activity around the city on Sept. 16, as part of their campaign against criminality and illegal drugs, on Sept.16.

Bacoor City chief of police, Supt. Vicente Cabatingan, on Tuesday said the activity aims to bring the police force closer to city folks and aims to promote a healthy and fit lifestyle through biking.

The activity also hopes to highlight the city's strong campaign against criminality and illegal drugs.

The Bacoor City Police Station topped the illegal drug operations in the whole province for the period Aug. 28 to Sept 3, 2018.

"This is one of our mechanisms to maintain that status," Cabatingan added.
