DOT-9 HOLDS TOURISM CRISIS MANAGEMENT SYMPOSIUM

ZAMBOANGA CITY -- Tourism industry stakeholders from all over the region underwent a symposium on Tourism Crisis Management on Tuesday to heighten preparedness in their respective businesses.

Myra Paz Abubakar, Department of Tourism-9 (DOT-9) director, said the symposium aims to highlight crisis management as integral to the successful implementation of tourism programs and sustainable management of destinations.

She aid crises can happen anytime and can potentially debilitate a "profitable and robustly growing" tourism industry in the region.

The Tourism Act of 2009 , she said, provides the imperative for the DOT to develop a crisis management framework most relevant, and can be implemented by tourism industry stakeholders to mitigate possible social, economic and environmental impacts should any crisis occur.

The symposium attendees were tourism stakeholders both from the local government units and private sector, as well as security sector from all over Zamboanga Peninsula.

"We deem it timely to hold the event and call all tourism stakeholders for a meaningful exchange of ideas and deepen understanding of the PUKSA Crisis Management Flow, which the Department wishes to share to all tourism stakeholders," Abubakar said.

PUKSA is a crisis management program tailored to the tourism industry. It will become a continuing cycle of establishing systems and procedures to be used in combating risk factors identified as PESTE: Political turmoil, Economic instabilities, Social disturbances, Technological attacks and Environmental hazards.

Among the topics discussed were: understanding crisis management and the tourism industry; situational awareness; emergency management in the tourism industry; and, briefing on how to draft an emergency management plan.

Participants also held a workshop on the formulation of crisis management plan and presentation of the draft on tourism crisis management plan.

Eugene Boco, safety and security consultant, told symposium participants that the emergency management plan they will draft should be based and applicable to a certain area or tourism site.

Boco said there should also be coordination between the tourism establishment and the local government, which is the lead agency as far as security is concerned. (PNA)
