4 DRUG 'DEALERS' NABBED IN ILOILO CITY

ILOILO CITY -- Four drug suspects were apprehended for possession of PHP150,000 worth of suspected "shabu" (crystal meth) in Iloilo City on Wednesday night.

The elements of the Iloilo City Drug Enforcement Unit (CDEU) and Lapaz police conducted a buy-bust operation in Barangay Lopez Jaena, Lapaz, Iloilo City against Frederic Sumollo, 26, at about 11 p.m.

Senior Police Officer 2 Alfred Tilano, team leader of CDEU, said the operation began when their poseur buyer met with Sumollo to buy a sachet of shabu worth PHP5,000.

However, the subject did not have enough drugs on hand so he called his colleagues to bring him more, Tilano said in an interview.

Tilano said a few moments later, the three other suspects, identified as Gus Salarda, 45; Lexie Cordero, 23; and Jenifer Potato,40, came to bring more shabu.

These drug suspects were newly-identified, he added.

Recovered from the suspects were 11 more sachets of suspected shabu, weighing about 12 grams, and with an estimated value of PHP150,000.

Tilano said they have been monitoring Sumollo and identified him as a "downline" of a big drug group in Iloilo. However, he refused to name the group.

"We find it hard to subject him to a buy-bust because he usually transacts only with his friends," he said.
The four drug suspects were detained at the Lapaz Police Station and will be charged with violation of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act. (PNA)
