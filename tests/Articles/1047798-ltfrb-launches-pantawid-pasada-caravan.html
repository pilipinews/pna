LTFRB LAUNCHES PANTAWID PASADA CARAVAN

MANILA -- The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) will hold its two-day caravan of the Pantawid Pasada fuel voucher cards for public utility jeepneys (PUJ) operators and drivers in Metro Manila.

The distribution of the Pantawid Pasada cards will be held at the San Andres Sports Complex in Malate, Manila from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Thursday and 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Friday.

"We are expecting around 2,000 beneficiaries to attend the caravan while we will be processing documents of walk-in applicants," the LTFRB said in a statement Wednesday.

The Board encourages PUJ operators and drivers who have legitimate franchises to claim their Pantawid Pasada cards.

The LTFRB will be announcing the next schedules and venues of the card distribution for those who will not be able to get their cards this week.

Under the program, a lump sum subsidy of PHP5,000 will be provided to around 179,000 jeepney operators and drivers until the end of 2018.

Pantawid Pasada aims to mitigate the impact of the recent series of oil price increases and higher excise taxes due to the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion (TRAIN) law.

According to the guidelines, Pantawid Pasada cards will be provided to the beneficiaries and processed by the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP). The beneficiaries will have to sign a deed of undertaking that the voucher cards will only be used for purchases of petroleum products at gasoline stations.

Each fuel card contains the complete name of franchise holder, plate number of the PUJ, region where the franchise was registered and card number.

Drivers and operators need to present a government issued ID and its photocopy to avail of the fuel subsidies. The LBP will issue the card once their names are verified on the master list issued by the LTFRB.

A budget of PHP977 million will be allocated to the fuel subsidy program for its implementation this year.

Around PHP3.86 billion is set to be allocated to provide a PHP20,515 yearly subsidy by next year. (PR)
