CAMPAIGN PERIOD FOR MARAWI VILLAGE POLLS STARTS SEPT. 12

MANILA -- The campaign period for the barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan (SK) elections in Marawi City will start on Wednesday, Sept. 12.

In a statement Tuesday, the Commission on Elections (Comelec) said those who are participating in the village and youth polls have eight days from Sept. 12 until Sept. 20 to persuade voters to vote for them in the upcoming polls.

One barangay chairman and seven barangay kagawads will be elected on September 22.

Also, one SK chairman and seven SK kagawads will be elected during the scheduled polls.

A total of 79,289 total ballots will be used in the Marawi BSKE, 53,009 of which will be for village voters and 26,280 ballots for youth voters.

The election period began Aug. 17 and ends September 29.

Last May 14, the barangay and SK polls were held nationwide, except in Marawi City, which was torn by the five-month conflict between government troops and the Maute terrorist group. (PNA)
