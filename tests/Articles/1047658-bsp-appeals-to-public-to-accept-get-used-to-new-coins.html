BSP APPEALS TO PUBLIC TO ACCEPT, GET USED TO NEW COINS

CONFUSING. Consumers and public vehicle passengers tend to confuse the new PHP5 coin for the old PHP1 as they are almost of the same size and the same color.

DUMAGUETE CITY - The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) in Negros Oriental has appealed to the public to accept the new series of coins, which many people have complained about apparently for causing "confusion".

Consumers and public utility vehicle passengers have noted that the new PHP5 coin is of the same size as the old PHP1, thus the confusion.

Dr. Gregorio Baccay, who heads the Economic and Financial Learning Center of the BSP here, said, "Atong giawhag ang publiko sa pagdawat niining maong mga sinsilyo nga mao na unya ang mu replace sa atong karaan nga serye sa sinsilyo (we are appealing to the public to accept and get used to the new series of coins as these will replace the old coins)" once they are demonetized.

At the same time, he explained to the public how to get used to the new coins.

"Kabahin sa mga new coins nato, ang atoa ra gyud nga basis sa pag (regarding our new coins, our basis to) identify is look and feel," he said.

To look means to see the sides of the new coins, as these have new designs, and to feel, meaning to check on the edge if they are plain or with ridges, he added.

Baccay also explained that the new series of coins has added security features such as micro-prints and mint marks.

He clarified, however, that the old peso coins are still legal tender even as the new series of coins have already been released.

"Sa pagkakaron kaning serye sa karaan nga sinsilyo magpabilin pa gihapon sa sirkulasyon until such time nga ang Bangko Sentral mutawag na o mu recall na sa karaan nga mga sinsilsyo (right now, the old series of coins continue to be in circulation until such time that the Bangko Sentral will recall these)," he said.
