12 INJURED IN MISOR ROAD MISHAP

CAGAYAN DE ORO CITY- Some 12 passengers, including three drivers, were injured when three vehicles figured in a collision Monday evening at the boundary of Gitagum and Libertad towns, Misamis Oriental province.

Involved in the accident was a commercial bus of Super 5 Transport, a winged-van, and a 10-wheeler truck.

According to witnesses, nine of the wounded passengers were brought to Misamis Oriental Provincial Hospital in Initao town, while the other victims were brought to this city for treatment.

Afryl Jay Bernas, 30, one of the bus passengers, said they were traveling from Cagayan de Oro City to Iligan when a van heading to Cagayan de Oro overtook the 10-wheeler truck, forcing the bus driver to make a sudden stop.

Bernas, who sustained injuries on his knees, said this led the three vehicles into a pile-up.

He said it took Good Samaritans from the area three hours to pull the three drivers out of their respective vehicles. He said the three drivers have been declared safe but are still under medical observation. (PNA)
