ALAMINOS CITY, PANGASINAN -- The city government has installed an additional 35 units of payaos to provide sustainable livelihood to the fishermen here and keep them from turning to illegal fishing.
City Agriculturist Arceli Talania, in an interview on Wednesday, disclosed that the city spent PHP300,000 for all 35 units of payao. The number brought the total units of payao to 42.

Talania said payao, an artificial floating reef that attracts all sizes of fishes, is made of two plastic gallon containers that serve as floaters, and coconut leaves as its raft.

"The coconut leaves will (host) algae after a week in the seawater. The algae will soon draw the small fishes as they feed on it, while the small fishes will draw big fishes as their main predator. This will be beneficial for our fishermen as they need not go far to fish," she explained.

"Mayor Arthur Celeste saw its positive effect, increasing the catch of our fishermen. That's why, we adopted it," she added.

Talania said the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) was the first to introduce 'payao', providing the city 15 units. However, due to typhoons, some were damaged while others were stolen, leaving them with only seven.

She clarified that fish nets are not allowed to be used in payao fishing.

The payaos, which were placed along the boundary of the Hundred Islands National Park on Monday, serve as markers of safe fishing zone, preventing the fishermen from fishing within the protected areas, she noted.

"We are with Task Force Isla and the barangay councils in monitoring and preserving the payao," Talania added. (PNA)
