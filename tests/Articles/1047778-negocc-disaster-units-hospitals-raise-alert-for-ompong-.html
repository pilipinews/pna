NEGOCC DISASTER UNITS, HOSPITALS RAISE ALERT FOR 'OMPONG'

BACOLOD CITY -- Negros Occidental Governor Alfredo Marañon Jr. on Wednesday advised all local disaster councils and government hospitals to heighten their preparedness and take precautionary measures for possible flooding, flash floods and landslides ahead of the expected onslaught of Typhoon Ompong.

Marañon, also the chairman of the Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council, directed the city and municipal disaster councils to place their operation centers on "blue alert" status and to closely monitor their respective areas of responsibility.

"Blue alert" means 50 percent of personnel must be at their posts at any time.

The governor also advised all district hospitals to be on "code white" alert, which puts all hospital staff in readiness to respond to any emergency situation or health-related incidents.

In Bacolod, the City Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (CDRRMC) held a meeting to discuss readiness and response measures for the typhoon.

Chief Insp. Sherlock Gabana, city police information officer, said all police stations have been informed of the advisory from the Police Regional Office 6 (Western Visayas) to prepare and account their search and rescue resources.

They are also directed to check their respective areas of responsibility, and coordinate with the CDRRMC. (PNA)
