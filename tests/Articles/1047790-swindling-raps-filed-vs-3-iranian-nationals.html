SWINDLING RAPS FILED VS. 3 IRANIAN NATIONALS

DUMAGUETE CITY - Philippine National Police (PNP) authorities have filed criminal charges against three Iranian nationals for alleged swindling under the Revised Penal Code.

Senior Insp. Antonio Jabar, police chief of Manjuyod, Negros Oriental, on Wednesday said the suspects were subjected to inquest proceedings at the Provincial Prosecutor's Office at the Hall of Justice here on Tuesday.

"Naka file na kami ug kaso nga swindling against ani nila nga mga foreigners (we have already filed a case for swindling against these foreigners), pero ang Dumaguete PNP naa pod sila lain nga gi-file naa usab laing biktima sa siyudad (but the Dumaguete PNP is also filing a separate charge because of another victim in the city)," he said. Jabar.

The suspects, all male and single Iranian nationals, were identified as Hossein Farrokhzadeh, 25, Alireza Roshandel, 27, and Davood Shaabani, 35. They were arrested Monday evening following a hot pursuit operation by police personnel from Manjuyod and the adjacent town of Ayungon.

An initial police investigation disclosed that the suspects defrauded businessman Renato Olpos Abuso, 51, married, a resident of Barangay Bolisong, Manjuyod and owner of Dhongkies General Merchandise in Poblacion Barangay of the same town while purportedly pretending to do business at the store.

The police said the suspects engaged in some manipulation tactics and swapped bogus money with the victim.

After managing to get PHP10,000 from the storeowner, the Iranian nationals fled on board a Toyota Vios car without plate number, heading towards the nearby town of Ayungon, Jabar said.

"Paspas kayo ang panghitabo ug mibiya dayon ang mga suspetsado sakay sa Toyota Vios (everything happened so fast and the suspects fled immediately on board a Toyota Vios)," he said.

The storeowner immediately discovered that he was duped and called for police assistance, which led to the suspects' arrest later in nearby Ayungon, with the help of the local police in the town.

According to Jabar, the Iranian nationals had also purportedly victimized a businesswoman identified as Dorothy Mansing Sapan, 35, a resident of Pinili Street in Dumaguete.

The woman has positively identified the three foreign suspects as the ones who duped her, the Manjuyod police chief said.

Meanwhile, police in Bacolod City, Negros Occidental are also coordinating with their counterparts here to verify whether the Iranian nationals are the same foreigners, who were reported to have also engaged in swindling activities in that city, Jabar said.

The suspects are now detained at the Dumaguete Police Station's lock-up facility as criminal charges are being prepared against them. (PNA)
