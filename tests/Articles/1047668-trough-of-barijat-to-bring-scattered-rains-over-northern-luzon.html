TROUGH OF 'BARIJAT' TO BRING SCATTERED RAINS OVER NORTHERN LUZON

MANILA -- The trough of tropical storm with international name "Barijat" (formerly "Neneng") will bring cloudy skies with scattered rain showers and thunderstorms over Batanes, Babuyan Group of Island and Ilocos, the weather bureau said Tuesday. 

In its latest bulletin, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) said "Barijat" was last eyed 425 kilometers west of extreme northern Luzon, outside the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR). 

Metro Manila and the rest of the country will experience partly cloudy to cloudy skies with isolated rain showers caused by localized thunderstorms.

Meanwhile, PAGASA is also monitoring typhoon "Mangkhut," which was last tracked 1,650 kilometers east of southern Luzon, outside PAR.

"Mangkhut" heads west at 30 kilometers per hour, it added.

Moderate to strong winds will blow over northern Luzon, and the western section of central and southern Luzon. Coastal waters along these areas will be moderate to rough.

Elsewhere, winds will be light to moderate with slight to moderate seas, PAGASA said. (PNA)
