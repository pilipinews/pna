3 KILLED, 4 WOUNDED AS ARMY, NPA CLASH IN DAVOR

DAVAO CITY -- Two members of the New People's Army (NPA) and a soldier were killed in an encounter between communist insurgents and troops under the Army's 28th Infantry Battalion (28 IB) in the Davao Oriental town of Lupon early morning Thursday.

Lt. Col. Miguel Ramon, 28 IB commander, said the firefight in Sitio Sigang, Barangay Maragatas also resulted in the wounding of four soldiers and the recovery of high-powered firearms at the encounter site.

Ramon said the troops were patrolling the area following reports of NPA presence near the village when the clash erupted.

"They chanced upon the armed group, then a firefight ensued," Ramon said, adding it lasted about 20 minutes. He said the rebels belong to Section Committee 18 and the Pulang Bagnai Company 6.

Ramon identified the lone fatality on the government side as Private Jomarie Timothy Estrella, and the wounded as Private 1st Class (Pfc) Jobel Gallana Abascar, Pfc Armand Teclera Polistico, Private Richard Petere Jr., and militiaman Ranel Maniques.

The two slain rebels were identified only as alias Taniel and Dahgol, team leader and vice team leader of Section Committee 18, respectively.

Ramon said government troops recovered two M16 rifles, an M203 grenade launcher, and an improvised explosive device (IED).
Since April this year, Ramon said the 28 IB has already engaged the rebels five times.

Ramon said he is saddened by the soldier's death, adding "this is the price we pay to fulfill our sworn duty to liberate the community from terrorist fear."

The wounded soldiers were initially sent to Camp Panacan Station Hospital here but were eventually transferred to another medical facility for further treatment. (RHODA GRACE SARON/PNA)
