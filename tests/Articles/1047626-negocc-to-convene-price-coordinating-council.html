NEGOCC TO CONVENE PRICE COORDINATING COUNCIL

BACOLOD CITY -- Negros Occidental Governor Alfredo Marañon Jr. will convene the Local Price Coordinating Council (LPCC) this week.

The governor asked the Metro Bacolod Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MBCCI) on Monday night to set the meeting with acting Provincial Administrator Lucille Gelvolea and Provincial Agriculturist Japhet Masculino, said MBCCI chief executive officer Frank Carbon.

"The governor has agreed to our sentiments that there is an urgent need for the council to convene," he said.

Carbon pointed out that measures should be put in place since Typhoon Mangkhut is expected to hit the country this week and prices of fish products could surge anew.

Marañon chairs the LPPC at the provincial level, with member-agencies like the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), Department of Agriculture (DA), and National Economic and Development Authority.

Sectoral representatives of agriculture, manufacturing and retail, who are appointed by the governor, are also part of the council.

Earlier, DTI said the upward adjustments in the prices of basic and prime commodities in Negros Occidental are still within the 10 percent allowable increase.

DTI-Negros Occidental provincial director Lea Gonzales, who also sits as the vice chairman of the LPCC, said the increases are not alarming.

Gonzales said those with "huge" price increases are agricultural products, such as rice.

The DTI is monitoring such basic necessities as soap, milk, coffee, salt, bread, and sardines. Prime commodities include noodles and all kinds of canned goods except sardines. (PNA)
