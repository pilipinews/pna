LAOAG CITY- The Philippine National Police is ready for the incoming weather disturbance locally named Typhoon 'Ompong' (Mangkhut).

Visiting the different police stations and other units to check their readiness, Chief Supt. Romulo Sapitula, Regional Director of the Police Regional Office 1, directed his men "to maximize the possible deployment of personnel for search and rescue operation."

He also advised all PNP units to undertake precautionary measures and other disaster preparedness activities; and ensure readiness of the SRR equipment and supplies to support operational requirements.

A simultaneous showdown inspection and inventory of search and rescue equipment was also conducted in the entire region to ensure the operational readiness of the police before, during, and after Tropical Depression "Ompong", which is moving fast towards northern Luzon.

In Ilocos Norte, Provincial Director Senior Supt. Cesar R. Pasiwen also led the accounting of personnel and reserved teams ready for deployment in cases of any eventualities. But prior to deployment, cops were also reminded to secure their homes, properties and families for them to have no worries and to focus in the rescue operations if needed.
