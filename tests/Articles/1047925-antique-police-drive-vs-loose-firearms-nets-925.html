ANTIQUE POLICE DRIVE VS. LOOSE FIREARMS NETS 925

SAN JOSE DE BUENAVISTA, ANTIQUE -- The Antique Provincial Police Office's (APPO) intensified campaign against loose firearms and those with expired licenses under the "TokHang Kontra Guinadilian nga Pusil" has netted 925 firearms from the province's 18 municipalities.

APPO Deputy Director for Operations Supt. Norby Escobar, in an interview Thursday, said since they launched the campaign last July 23, they were able to confiscate 447 unregistered or loose firearms, mostly homemade, out of the 925 that were seized.

"There were also 478 firearms that had been deposited at the police stations while the owners are still working on their license renewal," Escobar said.

He said the police campaign against loose firearms has so far reduced the shooting incidents in the province.

Escobar, however, said the chiefs of police in the municipalities should continue their campaign because they still have to attain their target of 3,061 firearms within the year. (PNA)
