2 CEBU JAIL PERSONNEL, DETAINEE AMBUSHED

CEBU CITY -- Two Cebu Provincial Detention and Rehabilitation Center (CPDRC) personnel and a high-profile inmate were slain in an ambush in Barangay Kalunasan here Thursday morning.

The ambush victims were identified as Prison Guard 1 Bernie Bayuta, CPDRC driver Joel Tevez and inmate Jerryfer Peregrino, who was imprisoned on illegal drug charges.

Guadalupe Police commander, Chief Insp. Eduard Sanchez, said in an interview that based on initial investigation, the victims were on board the CPDRC vehicle on their way to the Cebu City Hall of Justice to attend a hearing when four suspects riding on two motorcycles sprayed them with bullets using high-powered firearms.

Sanchez said they are still doing background checks on the victims, except for Peregrino, who was about to be charged again for possession of illegal drugs inside the CPDRC after four medium-sized packs of "shabu" (crystal meth) and drug paraphernalia were found inside his cell during a Greyhound Operation last August 4.

Cebu City Police Director Royina Garma, on the other hand, said the Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP) should be advised to be very extra careful when transporting prisoners.

"Malay natin baka rescue operation yung nangyari (For all we know, it was a rescue operation)," Garma said.

"I'm advising the BJMP na mag wang-wang sila (to use their siren) when transporting inmates. Huwag kayong magpa-ipit sa kalsada (do not allow yourselves to be stuck in traffic) because it's very dangerous. The BJMP should also be given special consideration on the streets," the CCPO chief added.

Meanwhile, Governor Hilario Davide III said he will place all jail guards at CPDRC under investigation following the latest discovery of drugs within the prison facility.

Davide, who went to the ambush site, said the sneaking of illegal drugs and contraband inside the CPDRC has to stop. (PNA)
