ILOILO CITY, CAPIZ POLICE OFFICES GET NEW CHIEFS

ILOILO CITY -- The Iloilo City Police Office (ICPO) and Capiz Police Provincial Office (CPPO) will have new chiefs starting Wednesday.

Senior Supt. Henry Bi単as, director of ICPO, will be replaced by Senior Supt. Martin Defensor of the Regional Headquarters Support Group (RHSG) while Senior Supt. Samuel Nacion, director of CPPO, will be replaced by Senior Supt. Canilo Fuentes, chief of the Regional Personnel and Human Resource Development Division (RPHRDD).

Bi単as will take over Defensor's post while Nacion will be the Chief of the Regional Headquarters Support Group.

In an interview Tuesday, Chief Supt. John Bulalacao, director of Police Regional Office 6 (Western Visayas), said the transfer is part of the "regular movement" of police officers.

"Especially now that we are recruiting new police officers and we will also be recruiting non-uniformed personnel," he said.

Bulalacao said he designated Fuentes to head the CPPO because Nacion already reached his two-year tour duty.

"He needs to be replaced for exterior advancement and I only see Bi単as as the most qualified to take over the post of Defensor," he said.

Bulalacao noted that Bi単as and Nacion have performed well in their respective posts.

He recalled that Nacion was a national awardee as Best Senior Police Commissioned Officer for Administration during the Police Service Anniversary.

"He is already capable of becoming chief directorial staff," he said, adding that Nacion is already applying in Camp Crame for the post.

Bulalacao said they are expecting more uniformed personnel to be relieved of their posts. (PNA)
