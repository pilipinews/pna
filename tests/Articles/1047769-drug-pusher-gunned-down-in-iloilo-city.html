DRUG PUSHER GUNNED DOWN IN ILOILO CITY

ILOILO CITY - Five unidentified motorcycle-riding suspects gunned down a drug pusher at Zone 5, Ungka village, Jaro in this city on Tuesday late afternoon.

The victim, Gerardo Mamarion, 25, a tricycle driver and a resident of Tacas village, Jaro, Iloilo City succumbed to multiple gunshot wounds in his body, said Chief Inspector Tranquilino Querubin, chief of police of Jaro Police Station, in an interview on Wednesday.

Querubin said that helmet-wearing suspects were on board three motorcycles. Two suspects behind the drivers were the gunmen while the other one was driving alone, he added.

This is the third slaying in the city this month perpetrated by motorcycle-riding gunmen.

The victim was supposed to buy from a store when he was gunned down around 5 p.m.

Recovered from the crime scene were seven empty shells from suspected .45 caliber pistols.

Querubin said Mamarion is not on their illegal drug watch list but the police has been receiving reports of him involved in selling of illegal drugs.

He also identified the victim as one of the suspects behind the killing of two ice cream vendors in Tacas village, Jaro, Iloilo City in January 2016.

"The suspects killed him maybe because of that," he said.

He said they are still conducting a thorough investigation of the incident.

Policemen are also looking for closed-circuit television (CCTV) camera installed near the crime scene to help identify the suspects.

Last September 7, a drug surrenderer was killed by four unidentified motorcycle-riding suspects at Zone 5, Calumpang village, in Molo.

Another drug surrender was killed in the evening of the same day in Ingore village, Lapaz. (PNA)
