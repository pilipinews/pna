MAYOR SARA PUSHES FOR STRONGER DAVAO-KAUAI, HAWAII COOPERATION

DAVAO CITY -- The visit of Davao City Mayor Inday Sara Z. Duterte to Kauai County has reaffirmed this city's mutual cooperation with the Hawaiian island in the areas of tourism, trade, agriculture, and cultural exchange.

Mayor Sara, who left this city on Monday for Hawaii, viewed her visit not only as an affirmation of the local government's partnership with Kauai but also seeks to deepen sisterhood relationship between both cities.

City Information Officer Jefry Tupas said on Tuesday that the mayor has underlined the city's deepening sisterhood relationship with Kauai because of shared similarities that transcend boundaries, diversity of the population, and environmental preservation.

Tupas said Kauai Mayor Bernard Carvalho Jr. also underscored the partnership of both cities, whose inhabitants share a deep sense of family, dedication to capacitate the youth, and connection to culture and heritage, and dedication to agriculture, tourism and other business and economic ventures.

It may be recalled that Mayor Sara and Carvalho inked a sisterhood agreement last February to boost agricultural trade, tourism and cultural exchange between the two cities.

During the signing of the sisterhood agreement, Carvalho highlighted his government's interest in coffee and cacao agricultural industries, which he said are aligned with the existing opportunities for chocolate products in Kauai.

Kauai, Hawaii's fourth largest island, is called the "Garden Island".

According to Kauai's tourism website, the county has emerald valleys, sharp mountain spires and jagged cliffs, and offers a variety of outdoor activities, such as kayaking at the Wailua River, snorkeling at the Poipu Beach, hiking the trails of Kokee State Park, or ziplining above Kauai's lush valleys.

Kauai is the first county in the US to be Davao's sister city and that the leaders of both cities hope to further positively impact on the ties of the Philippines and the United States of America. (LILIAN C. MELLEJOR/PNA)
