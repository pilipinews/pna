DAGUPAN BANGUS GROWERS URGED TO PREPARE FOR 'MANGKHUT'

DAGUPAN CITY -- The Dagupan City Agriculture Office (CAO) has advised milkfish (bangus) growers here to protect their fishponds and pens in anticipation of Typhoon Mangkhut, which is expected to hit northern Luzon, including this city.

In an interview Monday, City Agriculturist Emma Molina reminded them to take mitigation measures, such as providing barriers in fishponds and cages to prevent major losses.

"You can protect your stocks by putting nets on top (of ponds and dikes)," Molina advised bangus growers.

She said growers should constantly monitor their bangus, but if things took a turn for the worse, they should consider forced harvest as a last option.

The city agriculturist also clarified that there is no "undersupply" of bangus in the market despite rains and floods brought about by weather disturbances in the past months.

She said bangus growers decided not to immediately harvest their bangus to enable them to "mature" so they could fetch better prices.

Meanwhile, Molina reminded the public that Dagupan bangus' price is at PHP140 to PHP145 per kg. (PNA)
