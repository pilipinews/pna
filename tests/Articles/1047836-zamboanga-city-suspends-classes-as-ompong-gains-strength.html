ZAMBOANGA CITY SUSPENDS CLASSES AS 'OMPONG' GAINS STRENGTH

ZAMBOANGA CITY -- The local government on Thursday suspended classes in all levels, both in public and private schools, due to inclement weather spawned by Typhoon Ompong (international name "Mangkhut").

The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) placed several provinces on the eastern side of the country and northern Luzon under tropical cyclone warning signal number 1 as "Ompong" gains strength.

At 4 a.m. Thursday, the eye of "Ompong" was last observed at 855 kilometers east of Virac, Catanduanes. Its wind intensity is 205 kilometers per hour (kph) near the center and gustiness of up to 255 kph. It is moving inland at an accelerated pace of 30 kph.

The Barangay Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Councils (BDRRMCs) have been directed to continuously monitor the situation in their areas particularly those susceptible to floods, landslides and storm surge.

Dr. Elmeir Jade Apolinario, City Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office (CDRRMO) chief, has urged residents to heed the advisories of the BDRRMCs to prevent loss of lives and properties.

Apolinario said they activated the emergency operation center. The center is housed at the office of the CDRRMO.

The southwest monsoon continues to affect the western section of the country, particularly Palawan, western Visayas and Zamboanga Peninsula, including this city.

"Let us sustain vigilant monitoring of situation as weather condition remains abnormal," Apolinario said.

"Ompong" is expected to make landfall on the northern tip of Cagayan province on Saturday morning. (PNA)
