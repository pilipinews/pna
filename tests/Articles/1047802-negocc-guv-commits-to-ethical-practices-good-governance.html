BACOLOD CITY -- Negros Occidental Governor Alfredo Marañon Jr. has signed an integrity pledge, committing to ethical practices and good governance, as part of the province's partnership with the Local Government Integrity Circles (LoGIC) Network.

The governor was joined by Dr. Stefan Maria Jost, country representative of Konrad Adenauer Stiftung (KAS), in signing the document during their meeting held at the Governor's Office on Wednesday.

KAS Philippines co-implements the LoGIC Network, a project which aims to contribute to a culture of integrity in local government units (LGUs) all over the Philippines.

Acting Provincial Administrator Lucille Gelvolea said Negros Occidental is one of the 13 priority provinces, which have partnered with the LoGIC Network.

She said the partners were selected based on their rankings in the National Competitiveness Council and Seal of Good Local Governance Award as well as peace and order, and good governance.

The integrity pledge is a commitment to ethical practices and good governance, in which the Province of Negros Occidental pledges to combat graft in any form and in all activities as well as uphold, monitor, and ensure the implementation of Republic Act 6713 or the Code of Conduct and Ethical Standards for Public Officials and Employees. It also includes a pledge to maintain appropriate financial reporting mechanisms that ensure accuracy and transparency.

The partnership between Negros Occidental and LoGIC Network was formalized earlier in a memorandum of understanding setting forth the rights, responsibilities and cooperation procedures, and identifying the roles and responsibilities of each party as they relate to the development and sustainability of integrity mechanisms in business and investment-related procedures.

Last August 7-9, LoGIC Network held an introductory training for participants from the 13 provinces to build on the gains of the Partnerships for Integrity and Job Creation Project (Project I4J) by enhancing the capacity of integrity consultants and LGU provincial coordinators to fulfill their roles in developing, implementing, and institutionalizing integrity mechanisms at the local level and growing the LoGIC Network.

LoGIC Network is supported by the LoGIC Project, a three-year European Union (EU) and German Federal Ministry for Economic Development Cooperation (BMZ) co-funded project. (PNA)
