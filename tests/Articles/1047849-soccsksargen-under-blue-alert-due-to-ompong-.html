SOCCSKSARGEN UNDER 'BLUE ALERT' DUE TO 'OMPONG'

GENERAL SANTOS CITY -- The Office of Civil Defense (OCD) 12 (Soccsksargen) raised the "blue alert" status in the entire region starting Thursday due to the possible occurrence of floods and other weather-related disasters in line with the entry of Typhoon Ompong.

Jerome Barranco, OCD-12 assistant regional director, said the move is a precautionary measure as the imminent super typhoon continues to head towards northern Luzon.

Barranco noted that although the typhoon will not directly hit the area, it could trigger heavy rains that might lead to severe floods, landslides, and storm surges.

"Under 'blue alert' status, there are imminent or potential disasters that could happen," he said.

Barranco specifically cited possible flooding in low-lying areas and communities near river systems in the provinces of South and North Cotabato.

Among the identified danger zones are villages situated near the Liguasan Marsh and highland areas in North Cotabato, he said.

Under a "blue alert" status, half of the personnel of disaster management agencies would be on standby for contingencies.

Local disaster councils and member-agencies of the Regional Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council are mandated to monitor the situation in their areas of responsibility and immediately submit reports on incidents that might occur.

The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) noted in its latest weather bulletin that "Ompong" will mainly hit northern Luzon and the neighboring regions.

Dante Ariola, officer-in-charge of the PAGASA weather station here, said the entry of "Ompong" will likely intensify the southwest monsoon or habagat currently affecting the area.

He attributed the sporadic heavy rains these past days in this city and the neighboring provinces of South Cotabato and Sarangani to the effects of the southwest monsoon.

"These are not concentrated rains but localized thunderstorms that could trigger heavy rains," he said.

Some 341 of Soccsksargen's 1,194 barangays had been identified by the Mines and Geosciences Bureau as highly prone to flooding while 218 are at risk from landslides.

The flood-prone areas cover 179 barangays in North Cotabato and Cotabato City, 73 in Sultan Kudarat, 69 in South Cotabato, and 20 in Sarangani.

Of the landslide-prone areas, 57 barangays are located in South Cotabato and this city, 57 in Sultan Kudarat, 53 in North Cotabato, and 51 in Sarangani. (PNA)
