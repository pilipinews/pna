PAMPANGA ADEQUATELY PREPARED FOR 'OMPONG'

CITY OF SAN FERNANDO, PAMPANGA -- The Pampanga Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (PDRRMC) is adequately prepared to deal with hazards brought about by Typhoon Ompong should it make landfall on Friday, Acting Gov. Dennis "Delta" Pineda said Wednesday.

"Handang-handa po tayo sa ano mang kalamidad na mangyayari para tiyakin na ligtas ang mga tao (We are very much prepared for any calamity that may happen to ensure that the people are safe)," Pineda, co-chair of the PDRRMC, said.

He gave the assurance after holding a pre-disaster risk assessment (PDRA) to evaluate the level of risk, given the degree of exposure and vulnerability in a specific area.

The PDRA also makes an accounting of available resources such as personnel, food and medical supplies, and equipment.

Pineda said the PDRRMO has three professional rescue teams complete with protective gears, 23 government response vehicles, seven boats and 25 vehicles volunteered by the private sector and three permanent evacuation centers.

"On standby now are 18,400 packs of food items, 4,995 kabans of rice and 5,000 hygiene kits," he said.

PDRRM action officer Angelina Blanco said they advised local governments in 19 towns and two cities to activate their operation centers, preposition all available equipment and vehicles, monitor coastal and upland areas, and conduct preemptive evacuation, if necessary.

Hilton Hernando, head of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration's Pampanga River Basin Flood Forecasting and Warning Center, said "Ompong" is headed toward Batanes province, Cagayan Valley and Ilocos regions.

Pampanga, he said, would most likely experience localized thunderstorms before Sept. 14 and get more rains during the onslaught of the typhoon.

Barren Parungao of the Mines and Geosciences Bureau said upland communities in Arayat, Floridablanca, Porac, and Mabalacat City should watch out for landslides.

Pineda said they expect "Ompong" to worsen flooding.

PDRRMC members such as the Philippine National Police, Philippine Army's 48th Infantry Battalion, Department of the Interior and Local Government, Bureau of Fire Protection, National Food Authority, and Philippine Information Agency have been on heightened alert in the run-up to "Ompong's" landfall.

Rains triggered by the habagat (southwest monsoon) and seven tropical cyclones left 193 villages in the province under one to three feet of floodwater from Aug. 10 to 31, affecting 83,142 families, or 350,618 persons, and forcing 521 families, or 2,080 persons, to stay in evacuation centers.

The floods also damaged PHP166 million worth of palay in the province.

The towns of Masantol, Macabebe, San Luis, Sasmuan, Minalin, Sto. Tomas and Guagua continue to be under a state of calamity, as declared by their respective local government units. (PNA)
