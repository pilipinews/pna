180 SOCOT WORKERS, EX-OFWS GET LIVELIHOOD AID

GENERAL SANTOS CITY - A total of 180 marginalized and distressed workers, including former undocumented Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs), in South Cotabato province have received more than PHP2-million worth of livelihood assistance from the national government.

Sisinio Cano, regional director of the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) 12 (Soccsksargen), said Thursday the initiative is part of the continuing rollout in the region of the Kabuhayan or DOLE Integrated Livelihood Program (DILP).

DILP is a flagship program of the agency that "seeks to contribute to poverty reduction and reduce the vulnerability to risks of the working poor, vulnerable and marginalized workers through emergency employment, promotion of entrepreneurship and community enterprises."

Cano said the beneficiaries, who were from Koronadal City and Polomolok town in South Cotabato, received starter kits for various mall livelihood ventures.

He said the assistance was distributed since last week to 170 workers from Polomolok town and 20 from Koronadal City.

In Polomolok, he said the recipients include self-employed workers with insufficient income, underemployed workers, farmers, senior citizens, persons with disabilities, parents or guardians of child laborers, and drug surrenderers.

"The livelihood assistance will serve as augmentation to their daily income, considering the significant increases in the prices of some basic commodities," Cano said in a statement.

He said the livelihood projects were chosen by the beneficiaries themselves and endorsed to DOLE-12 by the local government units.

The approved ventures or individual projects include rolling stores, mini eatery or carenderia, mini refreshment, food processing, and rice cakes or kakanin-making, he said.

As part of the project's support packages, Cano said beneficiaries will undergo a two-day capability building training, among them on simple bookkeeping and financial literacy.

He said the training is aimed at enhancing the capability of the beneficiaries in running their small businesses.

In Koronadal City, the 20 distressed and former undocumented OFWs received starter kits from DOLE-12 and the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA), through its "Balik Pinay, Balik Hanapbuhay" program.

At least 11 of the beneficiaries received starter kits for sari-sari stores and nine for rice retailing businesses.

Some of the OFW-recipients who already finished their contracts may also avail of a PHP20,000 financial assistance from OWWA. (PNA)
