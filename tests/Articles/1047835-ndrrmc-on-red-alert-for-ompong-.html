NDRRMC ON 'RED ALERT' FOR 'OMPONG'

MANILA -- With typhoon "Ompong" threatening a large part of the country, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council has been placed on "red alert" along with its Response Cluster, NDRRMC executive director Ricardo Jalad said Wednesday.

"The National Council is closely monitoring actions and preparations on the threats of the incoming typhoon in close coordination with its Regional DRRM Councils. This is to ensure the orchestrated response of the government to address the safety and welfare of communities likely to be affected," Jalad added in a statement.

Also, the Department of the Interior and Local Government has activated its reporting systems to closely monitor the preparations of local government units concerned particularly the implementation of pre-emptive evacuation.

While the Department of Social Welfare and Development has ensured the prepositioning of food and non-food items on the ground, and is preparing for possible augmentation of relief supplies to affected-communities.

Likewise, through the Department of Health, health teams, medicines and medical supplies have been pre-positioned for immediate access of those in need. Jalad said the Logistics Cluster led by the Office of Civil Defense has ensured that land, air, and sea assets are in place to immediately transport additional teams and supplies to stricken areas if necessary.

Quick response teams (QRTs) have been deployed in the province of Batanes and has established alternative communication devices to ensure that communication lines will remain open during the onslaught of the typhoon.

Additional QRTs and health emergency response teams are on standby for immediate deployment in affected areas. (PNA)
