ALBAY SUSPENDS THURSDAY CLASSES DUE TO 'OMPONG'

LEGAZPI CITY -- Classes in the elementary and high school levels in both public and private schools in Albay have been suspended on Thursday as Typhoon Ompong moved closer to the Bicol region, the Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (PDRRMC) announced on Wednesday.

The PDRRMC advised all local disaster councils in the three cities and 15 towns of Albay to be on heightened alert and to closely monitor the typhoon's status through bulletins issued by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services (PAGASA).

Albay Governor Al Francis Bichara, meanwhile, directed the Philippine Coast Guard to implement the "no sailing" policy in the ports of Legazpi, Tabaco, Pio Duran, and Libon, once PAGASA hoists storm warning signal No. 1.

Coastal villages in the eastern seaboard of the province were also warned of the occurrence of big waves while fishermen were advised not to venture into the sea.

Meanwhile, in Catanduanes, Virac town Mayor Samuel Laynes issued a memorandum to all barangay (village) captains to closely monitor the weather condition, take precautionary measures, and come up with a disaster preparedness plan. (PNA)
