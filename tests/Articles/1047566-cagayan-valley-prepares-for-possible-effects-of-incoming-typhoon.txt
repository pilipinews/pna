CAGAYAN VALLEY PREPARES FOR POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF INCOMING TYPHOON

TUGUEGARAO CITY - The Regional Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (RDRRMC) is preparing for the possible effects of the incoming Typhoon Mangkhut in Cagayan Valley.

The RDRRMC met Tuesday and tackled preparedness measures for the storm's entry into the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR) and the possibility that it might affect the region in the succeeding days.

The Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) 2 (Cagayan Valley) has ordered the repacking of relief goods and their pre-positioning in all provinces of the region, especially in the coastal towns.

RDRRMC chairman Dante D. Balao, said they have already advised the Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Councils (PDRRMO) and Municipal Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Councils (MDRRMC) to closely monitor the towns' sea coast and prohibit fishermen from venturing into the open sea to avoid accidents brought by big waves.

He also ordered that coordination be made with the local offices of various government agencies, such as the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG), the Philippine National Police (PNP) and the Philippine Air Force (PAF) for the implementation of measures should the region will be affected by the storm.

The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) - Northern Luzon weather specialist Romeo Ganal presented the track of the typhoon, which will be named "Ompong" once it enters the PAR.

The RDRRMC meeting was held early to ensure zero casualty among the residents of Cagayan Valley. (PNA)
