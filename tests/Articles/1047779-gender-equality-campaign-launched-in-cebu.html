CEBU CITY -- The "Samahan ng mga Pilipina para sa Reporma at Kaunlaran" (SPARK) launched its #inFAIRness campaign at the Cebu City Hall on Wednesday.

The #inFAIRness advocacy campaign of SPARK is aimed to break stereotypes and challenge assumptions towards gender equality, said SPARK trustee Maria Isabel Quimson.

It also seeks to normalize the role of men at home and recognize the importance of women's economic role, Quimson added.

"Some women are unpaid for rigorous work they do. It is very disheartening when you realize the burdens on women's backs on top of having to cook for their families and tend to their children. We believe that the way to achieve gender equality is by normalizing the role of women in the workplace and the role of men at home," Quimson said.

She urged everyone in the audience, particularly the male participants, to acknowledge the importance of gender equality.

"We (women) won't be able to achieve this (gender equality) without the help our men, our husbands, male government officials, and men everywhere in the community. So, please help us with our advocacy," Quimson told her audience in Cebuano.

A real gentleman will help his wife with household chores and promote shared tasks at home, she added.

The nationwide #inFAIRNESS movement, which was first launched at the Senate of the Philippines last August 15, is supported by "Investing in Women," an initiative of the Australian Government.

The regional launch in Cebu was held in partnership with the Cebu city government and was attended by local government officials, women's organizations, transport groups, and other relevant stakeholders.

Quimson said the campaign will utilize both the traditional and technological means to gather attention including posting of information in public offices, posting of stickers in public utility vehicles, and creating an online community on social media.

The campaign will also be launched in other parts of the country in the following months to come. (PNA)
