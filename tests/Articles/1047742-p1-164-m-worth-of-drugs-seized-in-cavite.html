GENERAL TRIAS CITY, CAVITE - This city police's Drug Enforcement Team (DET) seized about PHP1.164-million worth of suspected "shabu" (crytal meth) during simultaneous buy-bust operations on Tuesday and Wednesday.

Supt. Paul Bometivo, city police officer-in-charge, reported to Cavite Police Provincial Director Senior Supt. William Segun that eight suspects, listed as street level targets (SLTs), were arrested during three separate buy-bust operations in Sitio Sampalucan, Barangay Pasong Camachile 2 and Barangay San Francisco.

Bometivo said their intensified anti-illegal drug operations were in pursuit of the Cavite Provincial Police Office's Five Priority Projects to sustain the campaign against illegal drugs and criminality initiated by the provincial police director.

He said the DET's eight-hour anti-illegal drug operations, in coordination with the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency 4-A (Calabarzon) and barangay officials in area, which began Tuesday night, bagged four SLTs at the Tropical Village Pabahay 2000 housing site in Barangay San Francisco.

Police identified the suspects as Randy Taway Vargas, 37, of Country Meadow Subdivision; Pedro Oraña Lazaga, 36, sales agent, of Sto. Domingo, Bay, Laguna; and Myla dela Cruz Cervantes, 32, and Jervic Waminal Saguindao, 35, housekeeper - both from Sitio Ilang in Barangay San Francisco.

The law enforcers confiscated during the operation seven plastic sachets of suspected shabu, weighing about 24 grams with a street value of PHP150,000 and the buy-bust money. 
Authorities nabbed Dimarao Tanggao Bangon alias "Dima," 46, of San Agustin 1, Dasmariñas City, Cavite also in Tropical Village Pabahay 2000.

Bangon yielded five plastic sachets of suspected shabu weighing about 155 grams, with a street value of more than PHP1 million, and the PHP 9,000 buy-bust money.

Three other drug suspects were arrested during the buy-bust operations in Sitio Sampalukan, Pasong Camachille 2 at about 1:30 a.m. on Wednesday.

Arrested were Marissa Silangga Gonzales, 36; Jomerel Arcon Dumandan, 33, tricycle driver; and Gellie Lumbreras Primero, 35, all residents of Pasong Camachille 2.

The city DET seized from the suspects six plastic sachets of suspected shabu worth PHP6,500 and the buy-bust money.
