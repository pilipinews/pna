POLICE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR FOREIGN TERRORISTS: PRO-11

DAVAO CITY -- The Police Regional Office (PRO)-11 is on the lookout for foreigners who are possibly tied with local terrorists in Mindanao.

PRO-11 spokesperson Chief Insp. Milgrace Driz said they "have names" of foreigners who are in Mindanao and possibly having alliance with terrorists but she begged off from revealing their number.

Driz said the series of bombings in Mindanao have prompted the conduct of an intensified intelligence monitoring by the police. The latest reported violent incident was the two explosions in Isulan town, Sultan Kudarat earlier this month that left three persons dead and 36 others wounded.

Driz said all police units have been directed not to downgrade the full alert status and to intensify intelligence gathering to track down terrorists and prevent further atrocities.

Last week, PRO-11 Director Chief Supt. Marcelo Morales ordered police units around the region to implement "target hardening" measures on vital facilities.

He also reminded police units that the full alert status remains in effect after it was raised following the first bombing incident in Isulan on August 28.

"Stay, toe the line, and maintain pro-active (stance) with the area of Davao region," Morales said.

As authorities in Region 12 investigate the Isulan incident, the PRO-11 chief also directed all police units to conduct lateral coordination with police counterparts in the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and other law enforcement agencies.

"Strengthen and tighten the conduct of security measures, intensify intelligence monitoring and conduct pro-active measures on target hardening," Morales ordered the lawmen.

This developed after the PNP filed cases last week in relation to the Isulan and Lamitan, Basilan bomb explosions.

Among those named responsible were Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) member Aladin Mohammad Kikay as primary suspect; Esmael Abdulmalik alias "Abu Turaife"; Imam Animbang alias "Kagui Karialan"; Salahuddin Hassan; Gani Saligan; Jihad Abdulnasser alias "Jay-R"; Jihad Salapada Sabtula alias "Norton"; Abdulnasser Sabtula Guianid; Ismael Abubakar alias "Imam Bungos"; Morex Musa; Salahudin Eson; Totin Kutin; Raymond Ibad; Marcos Mula; Tukan Ulinpain; Arnold Sanday; Mohammad Gibon, alias "Momong Esmail"; alias "Nasser Macambang"; alias "Ustadz Roman"; alias "Kagui Tatang"; alias "Commander Saga Endong"; alias "Jabo"; alias "Dani Maliga", alias "Magsaysay" and several other John Does.
