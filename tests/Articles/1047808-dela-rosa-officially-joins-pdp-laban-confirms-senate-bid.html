DELA ROSA OFFICIALLY JOINS PDP-LABAN; CONFIRMS SENATE BID

MANILA -- Bureau of Corrections (BuCor) Director General Ronald "Bato" dela Rosa on Wednesday was sworn in as the newest member of President Rodrigo Duterte's party, and confirmed his Senate bid in next year's midterm elections.

The former national police chief took his oath as member of the ruling Partido Demokratiko Pilipino-Lakas ng Bayan (PDP-Laban) at the Senate before party president Senator Aquilino Pimentel III.

He was sworn in along with Office of Civil Defense (OCD) deputy administrator for operations Nicanor Faeldon and actor Philip Salvador.

Also present during the event was PDP-Laban vice chairman Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi.

In an ambush interview, dela Rosa confirmed that he will be gunning for a Senate seat in May.

Dela Rosa was included in the list of possible senatorial candidates of PDP-Laban which was submitted to the President earlier this month.

Pimentel earlier said he has officially asked Duterte to review and finalize the party's senatorial slate for the May 2019 elections.

Dela Rosa, who headed the government's war against illegal drugs before retiring from the Philippine National Police in April, has consistently made the Top 12 in pre-election surveys.

If elected, dela Rosa said he would focus on legislating measures concerning law enforcement, particularly in connection with illegal drugs and security.

On the other hand, Salvador did not specifically say what elective post he would seek while Faeldon said he wanted to join PDP-Laban to help promote federalism. (PNA)
