ZAMBOANGA CITY--The National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA), in partnership with the Philippine Information Agency (PIA), is launching on Friday the Kalinaw Kultura Mindanao in this city.

The Kalinaw Kultura Launching Program will be held at the Zamboanga State College of Marine Sciences and Technology (ZSCMST) and will be coupled with Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) Cultural Product exhibit.

PIA Director-General Harold Clavite on Thursday said the primary purpose of the activity is to raise public awareness about the rich, diverse, dynamic, and colorful Mindanao cultural heritage.

Clavite said the program also seeks to develop a deep appreciation for Mindanao culture through observation, instruction, and experience of local creative content and talents as well as promote and encourage preservation of Mindanao's crafts and creative arts.

He said Kalinaw Kultura seeks to share and promote Mindanao's pride among the youth, community leaders and influencers, tourists and netizens.

Dr. Pilar Banaag, NCCA communication committee vice head, said the program aims to promote the different cultures "to clear out some wrong notions of which people from Mindanao have projected pertaining to the different areas in the region."

"This is a way or a means for us in the NCCA to disseminate the different cultures, the behaviors, the arts, as well as the different people who are involved in Mindanao, that Mindanao is a peaceful area, Mindanao has its own culture, Mindanao is a nice place to stay," Banaag said.

The Kalinaw Kultura is a Mindanao-wide cultural dissemination roadshow to be held in the cities of Iligan, Butuan, Zamboanga, Davao, and Koronadal.

The launching here is the third of a series since the first and second was held in Iligan and Butuan cities. It will kick-off with a motorcade Friday afternoon from Mayor Vitaliano Agan Avenue to the ZSCMST campus, where the formal program will be held.

The program will be followed by the Kalinaw Kultura Fashion Show at the KCC Mall de Zamboanga, showcasing culturally-inspired haute couture and hablon collections.

The viewing of local cultural films at the Centro Latino Theater Room, which was also scheduled on Thursday, was canceled due to the inclement weather condition spawned by Typhoon "Mangkhut." (PNA)
