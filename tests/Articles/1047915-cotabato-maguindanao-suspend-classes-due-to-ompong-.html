COTABATO CITY - This city and four other local government units in Maguindanao and North Cotabato have suspended classes Thursday due to bad weather caused by Typhoon Ompong.

Aniceto Rasalan, the secretary to the city mayor, announced the suspension of classes in preschool, kindergarten, and elementary levels in both public and private schools due to heavy rains that prevailed since early Thursday.

"A weather update from the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) said rain showers would prevail from 6 a.m. to 4 p.m. so we have to think of grade-schoolers who are susceptible to respiratory illnesses," Rasalan said on behalf of City Mayor Frances Cynthia Guiani-Sayadi.

He also called on city residents to report instances of flooding and landslides in their respective communities.

In Pigcawayan, North Cotabato, classes in all levels have also been deferred due to the inclement weather.

"In times like this, families should be intact so parents need not worry about their kids in school amid the heavy rains," Pigcawayan Mayor Eliseo Garcesa Jr. said over a local radio station.

In Maguindanao, the towns of Buldon, Sultan Kudarat, Datu Odin Sinsuat have likewise suspended classes in kindergarten and elementary levels due to torrential rains.

Meanwhile, disaster management officials of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) met here Thursday to monitor the effects of the storm and ensure the safety of constituents in its component cities of Marawi and Lamitan, and the provinces of Maguindanao, Sulu, Tawi-Tawi, Basilan, and Lanao del Sur.

Light to moderate rains greeted early Thursday the entire ARMM, forcing education officials and local government executives to suspend classes in elementary and high school levels.

ARMM Governor Mujiv Hataman said light to moderate, yet continuous rains, and light winds forced education officials in his home province of Basilan to suspend Thursday classes in elementary, high school and college institutions.

Rescue workers of the Police Regional Office-ARMM, as well as soldiers under the Western Mindanao Command, have also been alerted for any eventuality.

Hataman said he is closely monitoring the situation through the Humanitarian Emergency Assistance and Response Team (HEART), which has personnel across the region.

"Preparation is the key so we can save lives and properties," Hataman said here Thursday afternoon following his meeting with disaster officials.

The Army's 6th Infantry Division, which covers the whole of Maguindanao, Sultan Kudarat and part of North Cotabato and Lanao del Sur, also prepared rapid deployment units to respond to flash floods, strong waves, and landslides. (WITH REPORTS FROM NOEL PUNZALAN/PNA)
