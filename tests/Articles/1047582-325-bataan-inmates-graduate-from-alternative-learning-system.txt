325 BATAAN INMATES GRADUATE FROM ALTERNATIVE LEARNING SYSTEM

BALANGA CITY, BATAAN - The Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP) on Tuesday announced that 325 inmates at the Bataan District Jail here have graduated from the Alternative Learning System (ALS) since 2013.

Jail warden Andrew Tauli said of the total number, 304 finished high school while 21 completed elementary school requirements. Of those who already graduated, 216 were males and the rest, females.

He said the BJMP program, in coordination with the Department of Education (DepEd), aims to give education to detainees who have not received formal schooling.

"ALS is designed to measure the competencies of those who have neither attended nor finished elementary or secondary education in the formal school system," Tauli said.

He led the distribution of graduation certificates to 52 male inmates who completed high school and 14 others who finished elementary.

He said that enrolled for the current school year are 70 inmates - 39 in high school and 31 in elementary.

The enrollees attend daily classes from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday to Friday.

Tauli said among other programs of the BJMP are livelihood and skills development for 1,178 male and about 120 female inmates in the former Bataan Provincial Jail.

The detainees are engaged in haircutting, pedicure, manicure, handicraft (basket weaving), garment sowing, picture frame making, mosaic making and baking.

"Inmates operate their own bakery where bread, cakes and cookies are sold to detainees and visitors," he added. (PNA)
