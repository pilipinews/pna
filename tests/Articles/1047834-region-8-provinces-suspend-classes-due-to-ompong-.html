REGION 8 PROVINCES SUSPEND CLASSES DUE TO 'OMPONG'

TACLOBAN CITY -- Some provinces and cities in Eastern Visayas have declared suspension of classes for elementary and high school on Thursday as Typhoon Ompong (international name "Mangkhut") moves closer to Luzon.

Classes were suspended in this city, the regional capital; Ormoc City in Leyte; entire Leyte province, Maasin City, Southern Leyte; Catbalogan City in Samar; and the entire province of Southern Leyte.

Tacloban City Mayor Cristina Romualdez said in an executive order issued Wednesday night that as a precautionary measure, cancellation of classes in both private and public school should be implemented.

The first to declare suspension of classes was Maasin City, the capital of Southern Leyte province. The temporary cancellation is extended until Friday.

The Southern Leyte provincial government asked its responders and concern government offices to monitor the situation and be "responsive to the demands of emergency situation."

Guidelines issued by the Department of Education (DepEd) allows local government units to cancel classes in their respective areas even without any typhoon warning signal.

DepEd Order No. 43 issued in 2012 assigns local government units to announce class suspensions not later than 4:30 a.m. for the morning classes and not later than 11:00 a.m. for afternoon classes.

Suspension of classes the following day will depend on the signal number declared at 10 p.m. and 4:30 a.m.

The directive also mandates public and private school officials to observe weather bulletins issued by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), and maintain communication with the local government unit and the disaster risk reduction management councils for updates during calamities.

Under the guideline, cancellation of classes will depend on the signal number raised by PAGASA. During signal number 1, preschool and kindergarten classes will be suspended.

For signal number 2, elementary and high schools classes will be suspended and when warning signal number 3, all government offices shall be closed.

Among six provinces, only Northern Samar was placed under warning signal no. 1 due to "Ompong", considered as the strongest typhoon to hit the country this year. (PNA)
