ARROYO ON NFA COUNCIL ABOLITION: 'WE'LL WORK ON IT'

MANILA - House Speaker Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo said Wednesday if President Rodrigo Duterte asks Congress to abolish the National Food Authority (NFA) Council, the House of Representatives will work on it.

Arroyo made the statement after Duterte revealed his plan to scrap the policy-making body of the NFA amid the country's rice woes.

"Well, if he (Duterte) asks for it, then we will work on it," she said in an ambush interview.

Arroyo said while she believes that the council can either be abolished or retained, she assured that the Lower House will accede to the President's policy call.

In a televised interview with Chief Legal Counsel Salvador Panelo on state-run PTV 4 on Tuesday, Duterte said he is considering recommending to Congress the abolition of the NFA Council.

The NFA Council, Duterte said, has not done any purpose. (PNA)
