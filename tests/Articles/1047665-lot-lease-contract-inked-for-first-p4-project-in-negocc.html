BACOLOD CITY -- The provincial government of Negros Occidental and Bacolod-based contractor Dynamic Builders and Construction Co. (Phil.), Inc. have signed the agreement for the province's first-ever public-private partnership for the people (P4) initiative.

The 50-year contract, which involves the lease of the 6,485-sq. meter Capitol property on Aguinaldo St. here, was signed by Governor Alfredo Mara単on Jr. and Dynamic Builders president Ricardo Yanson Jr. in a ceremony held at Seda Hotel's The Roof Deck on Monday night.

After the signing rites, Dynamic Builders turned over a symbolic check of PHP26.458 million to the province for its two-year advance rent and security deposit.

Mara単on, in a statement, said the event marks the beginning of the province's remarkable and long-term partnership with the private sector in terms of local business development.

The governor thanked Dynamic Builders for their trust and confidence in the provincial government as he acknowledged the support and cooperation of the Provincial Board led by Vice Governor Eugenio Jose Lacson, who signed as witness of the agreement with Dynamic Builders counsel Mitchelle Abella.

On the leased property, which is still occupied by the Provincial Administration Center, Dynamic Builders will develop the PHP1.7-billion Capitol Commercial Center, a 10-storey building that will house a hotel, shopping mall, business process outsourcing offices, and other commercial spaces.

The lessee will pay PHP551,225 per month. The 50-year rental escalates by 5 percent every five years.

Lacson had earlier said the provincial government is expected to generate at least PHP530 million in revenues from the deal.

On May 17 this year, the provincial government received an unsolicited proposal from Dynamic Builders for the lease of the 6,485-sq. meter property.

The P4 Committee, chaired by Acting Provincial Administrator Lucille Gelvolea, published an invitation for comparative proposals on July 25 and Aug. 1, and declared the Swiss Challenge officially closed without any challenger and recommended to award the lease project to Dynamic Builders on August 13.

On Sept. 5, the Provincial Board approved the ordinance granting authority to the governor to sign the agreement with the project proponent.

The P4 Code or the "A Provincial Code Pursuing a Public-Private Partnership for the People (P4) Approach Towards Development, Providing for the Procedure for Selecting the Private Sector Proponent, Adopting a Contract Management Framework, and Providing Appropriations and for Other Purposes" was approved by the Provincial Board in January this year.

Afterwards, Mara単on issued Executive Order No. 18-13 creating the Negros Occidental P4 Selection Committee (P4 SC), which is responsible for all aspects of the pre-selection and selection process in the implementation of a specific P4 project. (PNA)
