CITY OF MALOLOS, BULACAN - The National Food Authority (NFA) here intends to make brown rice as a staple among Bulakenyos.

In celebration of the National Rice Awareness Month, NFA-Bulacan employees headed by provincial manager Elvira Obana, together with several barangay officials in this city, on Thursday held a "boodle fight" with brown rice, fried chicken, roasted liempo, fried tilapia, grilled eggplant, and tomatoes.

"If brown rice will be fully introduced to Bulakenyos, the market price of this rice would be lower," Obana said.

She also noted the nutritional value of brown rice. "It is good to eat brown rice regularly because it has the vitamins for a stronger immune system. It is also a good way to prevent getting sick. It is also good for diabetics because brown rice (is packed with fiber, which) lower (blood) sugar," she said.

The NFA encourages Bulakenyos to try to serve brown rice in parties, fiestas, festivals and other special occasions.

"Kakaunti pa kasi ang nakakaalam kung ano ang nutritional value. Mas maganda talagang kainin ang brown rice dahil itinatanim ito na organiko ang mga pataba (Only a few know its nutritional value. It is indeed better to eat brown rice as it is grown using organic fertilizer)," Obana added.

Bulacan has no brown rice plantation so the NFA also wants to have a program with brown rice being widely cultivated.

Brown rice is classified as a special rice class in the markets. (PNA)
