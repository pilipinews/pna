MMDA DEPLOYS EMERGENCY PERSONNEL FOR 'OMPONG'

MANILA -- The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) is bracing for the possible impact of Typhoon 'Ompong' in Metro Manila.

Some 60 emergency personnel are on standby to provide critical services to the public at any given time, according to an MMDA advisory sent to the media Wednesday.

The agency is also set to deploy seven ambulances, two tow trucks, two military trucks, two fire trucks, one boom truck, and seven chainsaws.

The MMDA is ready to provide manlift, extrication equipment and rubber boats, if necessary.

Emergency stations were installed on Epifanio delos Santos Ave. (Edsa)-Roxas Blvd., Edsa-Orense, Edsa-Ortigas, Edsa-Timog, C5-Libis, Commonwealth-Tandang Sora and Nagtahan.

"Ompong", which entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility on Wednesday afternoon, is expected to bring heavy to intense rains, strong winds and storm surges in Luzon beginning Thursday. (PNA)
